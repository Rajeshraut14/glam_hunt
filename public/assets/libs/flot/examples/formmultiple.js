// Known Issues:
//
// * Patterns only support repeat.
// * Radial gradient are not implemented. The VML version of these look very
//   different from the canvas one.
// * Clipping paths are not implemented.
// * Coordsize. The width and height attribute have higher priority than the
//   width and height style values which isn't correct.
// * Painting mode isn't implemented.
// * Canvas width/height should is using content-box by default. IE in
//   Quirks mode will draw the canvas using border-box. Either change your
//   doctype to HTML5
//   (http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-doctype)
//   or use Box Sizing Behavior from WebFX
//   (http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/boxsizing/boxsizing.html)
// * Non uniform scaling does not correctly scale strokes.
// * Filling very large shapes (above 5000 points) is buggy.
// * Optimize. There is always room for speed improvements.

// Only add this code if we do not already have a canvas implementation
